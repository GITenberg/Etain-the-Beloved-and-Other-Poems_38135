<tr><td>
Strong in the strength that finds in gentleness<br />
A way to peace, King Eochaidh on the throne<br />
Of Erin sits. Around his footstool press<br />
Clansmen and chiefs. Some wind of thought has blown<br />
Their eyes to flame. Some purpose, in the stress<br />
Of travailing tongues, to birth finds not a way:<br />
What all would utter, none has wit to say.<br />
<br />
Into their midst one came, an agéd bard<br />
Upon whose flowing hair Wisdom had laid<br />
Her gift of silver. On those faces, scarred<br />
From old forgotten fights, he looked, and weighed<br />
The meaning in their eyes, though sorely marred;<br />
And from the tangled fibre of their thought<br />
Into the web of speech their purpose wrought.<br />
<br />
"Thy word, O King, has passed by hill and dale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><br />
Throughout all Erin, bidding to the Feast<br />
Of Tara all thy people, with the tale<br />
Of tribute due from greatest and from least.<br />
Nor should this word than others less prevail,<br />
But that the herald-spear thy will hath sent,<br />
Against the shield of custom has been bent.<br />
<br />
"Thou knowest, O King, that from most ancient years<br />
No chieftain wifeless rules for thee the land,<br />
Nor mateless at a festival appears;<br />
But fixed in all experience doth stand:<br />
And thus, made master of all human fears,<br />
Fears not, but strongly round the camp-fires goes,<br />
Full sharer of thy people's joys and woes.<br />
<br />
"Equal in yoke and honour, as the day<br />
And night, that are but breathings of the soul,<br />
They on life's crooked journey take their way<br />
Diverse in gift, in essence one and whole.<br />
This is the custom, King! Yet custom may,<br />
If but of man, be as a smith who twists<br />
An iron chain to bind upon his wrists.<br />
<br />
"But custom may, if fashioned to the Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><br />
That made the world, be as the straitened string<br />
From which the Master of the Feast may draw<br />
Majestic speech, a living, wondrous thing<br />
To rid the brow of pale contention's flaw,<br />
And passing like the honey-cup along,<br />
Gather their wandering lips to one great song.<br />
<br />
"And such the custom that thy people plead:<br />
For when of old the deathless Lord of Life<br />
Dagda came forth, and knew the immortal need<br />
That burned within his heart, he took to wife<br />
Dana the Mother of all human seed.<br />
In her his breath found music and a name.<br />
In her his fire has blossomed into flame.<br />
<br />
"Throughout the world that fire and music run<br />
One sings within the maiden's wondering heart:<br />
One stirs the veins of manhood, as the sun<br />
Sets the spring's fingers thrilling with the smart<br />
Of keen, ecstatic life that's but begun.<br />
In every seed that breaks and wind that blows,<br />
Each in the other seeks and finds repose.<br />
<br />
"Wherefore, O King, since thou art yet unwed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br />
And thus in kingship standest incomplete,<br />
Unfurnished in thy heart, from whence are fed<br />
The streams of power and wisdom, it is not meet<br />
That unto thee thy people bow the head,<br />
And here thy sovereignty with tribute own<br />
Till thou hast set a Queen upon thy throne."<br />
<br />
He ceased, and all the faces of the crowd<br />
Shone with the light that kindles when the boon<br />
Of speech has eased the heart; as when a cloud<br />
Falls from the labouring shoulder of the moon,<br />
And all the world stands smiling silver-browed.<br />
King Eochaidh for a moment bent his head<br />
In thought; then smiling he arose and said:<br />
<br />
"I am not careless of the ancient need<br />
That moves your minds. Within my own it moves<br />
Like a long-hidden, unforgotten seed<br />
The spring has touched uneasily: like hooves<br />
Long captive, when the trumpet has decreed<br />
A royal pilgrimage, and in the liss<br />
They dance to taste the highway's ringing bliss.<br />
<br />
"So have I watched for that sure sign that fills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br />
The horn of fate, that bending this our realm<br />
Unto the Will that works behind our wills,<br />
It may remain; as when storms overwhelm,<br />
And leafy spray whirls over the roaring hills,<br />
The swaying pine bends as the storm wars by,<br />
And lives to shake proud arms against the sky.<br />
<br />
"But now the horn is full, the hour is here.<br />
Our wills as one move onward to their end.<br />
Here now I lift on high the royal spear,<br />
And thus through Erin proclamation send:<br />
'Search for the promised maiden far and near<br />
Whom the high Gods have destined at my side<br />
To reign.' Go forth. The King awaits his bride.<br />
<br />
"She shall be found in some most quiet place<br />
Where Beauty sits all day beside her knee<br />
And looks with happy envy on her face;<br />
Where Virtue blushes, her own guilt to see,<br />
And Grace learns new, sweet meanings from her grace;<br />
Where all that ever was or will be wise<br />
Pales at the burning wisdom of her eyes.<br />
<br />
"When you at last, far off like worshippers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
Within some holy circle, bow your heads,<br />
You shall await till on that face of her's<br />
A smile like spring's first morning slowly spreads;<br />
And when her lip with wondrous music stirs,<br />
Bear hither like the wind her deathless name,<br />
That I may light my heart at its white flame."<br />
<br />
Scarce had he ceased when from the royal tent<br />
Broke the full tide of their loud ecstacy,<br />
And through the woods like summer thunder went,<br />
Full of great rumour of mighty things to be<br />
That died far off like twilight breezes spent.<br />
Then sang the bard in hidden wisdom skilled:<br />
"Thus is the purpose of the Gods fulfilled.<br />
<br />
"<i>Lift now the hands that may not bless</i><br />
<i>A wifeless feast, a queenless throne,</i><br />
<i>A court or council womanless,</i><br />
<i>Or life one-limbed and sideways grown,</i><br />
<i>That holds the hands that may not bless.</i><br />
<br />
"<i>The starry Virgin of the east</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br />
<i>Steps up the sky to lead the sign</i><br />
<i>Where most has kissed and mixed with least,</i><br />
<i>And one-in-twain life's torches shine</i><br />
<i>Behind the Virgin of the east.</i><br />
<br />
"<i>Then lift the hands that gladly bless</i><br />
<i>Full life, to life's great fulness grown,</i><br />
<i>A power to stand through shock and stress,</i><br />
<i>And rear an everlasting throne</i><br />
<i>Held high on hands that gladly bless.</i>"<br />
<br />
Then on a night when on his hearth the gleam<br />
Of crackling faggots flung a wavering glow<br />
Along his red-yew roof from beam to beam<br />
Like glancing eyes, King Eochaidh to and fro<br />
Turned on his couch, dreaming a happy dream<br />
Of snapping stems, and crisp leaves crushed by feet<br />
With high desire made musical and fleet.<br />
<br />
Out of the fire a swift and slender shaft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
Of yellow flame pierced through the King's dropped lids,<br />
And woke a murmur of bees whose eager craft<br />
Rifled the treasures of blossomy pyramids;<br />
Whereat the King, raising his hand, low laughed,<br />
Then passed like some worn swimmer on the sweep<br />
Of strong waves toward the unfathomed gulf of sleep.<br />
<br />
At length in that white hour when dewy wings<br />
Stir with new day's delight, there came a sound<br />
As though a passion of voices and smitten strings<br />
Mingled and swelled and flew along the ground,<br />
Till at the utmost of its triumphings,<br />
Through the King's sleep and on his door the dawn<br />
Broke, and a mighty shout: "Etain! Etain!"</td></tr>

Thereafter, on a morning rich with spring,<br />
When round his feet new-opened flowers looked up<br />
Wide-eyed and wet at some most wondrous thing,<br />
And crystal draughts from many an odorous cup<br />
Were spilled by winds in playful rioting,<br />
King Eochaidh stood beside a quiet shore,<br />
Dumb with a joy he never knew before.<br />
<br />
From league to league alone his path had lain<br />
On windy hills, through forests dark, or deep<br />
In dank, sonorous glens. Through every vein<br />
A burning joy had drunk the mists of sleep,<br />
And sung "Etain, Etain," till the refrain<br />
Irked, and he slept, and when he sprang awake<br />
Saw that which made his heart with rapture shake.<br />
<br />
There by the sea, Etain his destined bride<br />
Sat unabashed, unwitting of the sight<br />
Of him who gazed upon her gleaming side,<br />
Fair as the snowfall of a single night;<br />
Her arms like foam upon the flowing tide;<br />
Her curd-white limbs in all their beauty bare,<br />
Straight as the rule of Dagda's carpenter.<br />
<br />
Her cheeks were like the foxglove when it glows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><br />
At noon: her eyes blue as the hyacinth.<br />
Like moonlight struck to marble, nobly rose<br />
Her neck upon her shoulder's polished plinth;<br />
And like the light that swiftly comes and goes<br />
Through breaking waves, among her hair her hands<br />
Broke into wavy gold its plaited strands.<br />
<br />
Then came her maidens, bright and blossoming<br />
With beauty, and before her beauty bowed,<br />
And stood around her in a laughing ring<br />
To robe her starry splendour like a cloud.<br />
And as her hair they twined, the hidden king<br />
Scarce knew if on her lips, that knew no wrong,<br />
Or in his own hushed heart he heard this song.<br />
<br />
<i>The king comes riding from the north,<br />
From battles won, with marching men.<br />
Ah, whose white eager arms go forth<br />
To bid him welcome home again<br />
When he comes riding from the north?</i><br />
<br />
<i>The king comes riding from the south,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><br />
<i>And halts beside the royal liss.<br />
Ah, whose the happy smiling mouth<br />
That gives and takes a long warm kiss<br />
When he comes riding from the south?</i><br />
<br />
<i>The king comes riding from the east.<br />
O night how dark! O way how long!<br />
Ah, whose dear eyes shall light the feast?<br />
Ah, who shall lift his heart with song<br />
When he comes riding from the east?</i><br />
<br />
<i>The king comes riding from the west,<br />
And smiles unto himself, and sighs.<br />
Ah, whose the white and easeful breast<br />
Where he shall close his kingly eyes<br />
When he comes riding from the west?</i><br />
<br />
Small wonder now that Eochaidh's leaping heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><br />
Strained like a hound in leash: yet through his bliss<br />
There passed a thin cold blade with sudden smart<br />
Of doubt that he but dreamed, of dread that this<br />
Was but a vision that would soon depart:<br />
But when the song had ceased, there stood the maid<br />
Flushed with keen joy, and like a queen arrayed.<br />
<br />
A mantle of bright purple, waving, wound<br />
Her form, and from her shoulders white as milk<br />
Fell in reluctant folds and touched the ground.<br />
Upon her breast the flash of emerald silk&mdash;<br />
As though the glory of earth had wrapped her round&mdash;<br />
Mixed with the glow of red embroidered gold<br />
That seemed with light her body to enfold.<br />
<br />
A sudden breeze came singing from the sea<br />
And broke with sunlight through the leafy shade.<br />
Then came King Eochaidh forth, and on his knee<br />
Bent low before the silent, trembling maid.<br />
"The king," he said, "has come, and kneels to thee,<br />
Foredoomed to share the burden of his throne,<br />
And glorify its glory with thine own."<br />
<br />
Then through her frame a gentle tremor went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br />
And lit her face with exquisite swift fire<br />
That woke forgotten dreams, whose shaken scent<br />
Sweetened the quiet winds of her desire<br />
With some divine, unuttered ravishment,<br />
Some earnest of great doom that filled her heart<br />
With sorrow, joy's majestic counterpart.<br />
<br />
Upon his head she gently laid her hand,<br />
And said, "Arise! To thee my heart has bowed<br />
When minstrel after minstrel, tired and tanned,<br />
Has supped beside our hearth, and sung the proud<br />
High song that bears thy greatness through the land.<br />
For thee from life's clear dawn my love remained<br />
Fixed, and at length to thee I have attained."</td></tr>

Across the woods of Meath the bird of day<br />
Fell from the boughs of noon with bleeding wing,<br />
While dark-browed Balor strode the eastern way,<br />
And scattered darkness from his cloudy sling,<br />
Till at his feet the hosts of Erin lay<br />
Smitten with sleep; then round their dreams he cast<br />
The chains wherewith he binds his prisoners fast.<br />
<br />
From dawn till dark, in many a hero-game<br />
Glad eyes had flashed, or bent in pride august<br />
To hear the chant of some undying name<br />
Whose deeds were strong as wine. Anon the dust<br />
Of festive feet stormed in a wild acclaim<br />
Around the royal place where, side by side,<br />
Sat Eochaidh and Etain his new-made bride.<br />
<br />
Now ancient Sleep, with Silence for his queen,<br />
Reigns o'er those palaces of stately fir<br />
That drowse in curtained moonlight's misty sheen.<br />
Within, the arras hardly seems to stir<br />
Its languorous folds of purple, blue and green,<br />
Whose colours part or mix, as rise and fall<br />
The pine fire's odorous gleams on roof and wall.<br />
<br />
No sound, no life, save where with soft salute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><br />
The wide-eyed sentinels a moment wait<br />
And listen sidelong to the passing bruit<br />
Of ghostly winds, that murmur at their state<br />
And pass, with peevish cry and soundless foot,<br />
Where the dead fly upon the waveless moat<br />
Makes of the dead dropped leaf a funeral boat.<br />
<br />
Yet in the midst of silence so profound,<br />
One stirred his rushy couch as though in pain,<br />
For through his dreams a torrent of swift sound<br />
Stumbled in foam about his echoing brain,<br />
And all his thought in loud confusion drowned<br />
And bore him toward a dim and perilous steep<br />
That flung its shadow on a writhing deep.<br />
<br />
Then like the sun obscured by valley smoke,<br />
With some vague trouble glooming in his eye,<br />
Ailill the brother of the king awoke<br />
And scanned the portents of the morning sky,<br />
Till on his mind a mellowing radiance broke,<br />
And in his heart there dawned a wondrous face<br />
That lit his world with Love's exalted grace.<br />
<br />
Often in dreams a shadow by his side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br />
Had sung of one who came in some great hour<br />
With Love&mdash;and woe. Now came his brother's bride;<br />
And when he bent before her in her bower,<br />
Within his heart the shadow rose and cried,<br />
And passed away, while all his being shook,<br />
Stricken with joy and sorrow in a look.<br />
<br />
Among the clamours of the festal time<br />
His love for ease he hid, again pursued,<br />
Finding a solace in the chanted rhyme<br />
Of agéd bards, or youths in merry mood<br />
Where angry words were counted as a crime;<br />
And fireside friendship staunched his hungry sighs<br />
When she no more was banquet for his eyes.<br />
<br />
But when the marriage festival was past,<br />
And restless day gave place to torturing night,<br />
His captive passion burst its chains, and cast<br />
Its ardours from his brain in living light;<br />
Then like the thin voice of a spell-raised blast,<br />
A dissonant note from hidden harp-strings drawn<br />
Troubled the dreams of Eochaidh and Etain.<br />
<br />
By day the dream had faded to a mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><br />
In some far-folded valley of the mind;<br />
But when, heart-charmed in evening's amethyst,<br />
The labouring world grew wonderfully kind,<br />
And upturned lips by brooding love were kissed;<br />
Like silent rain in summer twilight spilled,<br />
A wandering thought King Eochaidh touched and chilled.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile with steps that would and would not shun<br />
Bliss craved and spurned; with tongue that might not speak<br />
The pain that some strange sweetness now had won,<br />
Ailill moved to and fro; and soon his cheek<br />
Paled like the austere Servants of the Sun;<br />
And day by day his passion's famished flame<br />
Nourished itself upon his wasting frame.<br />
<br />
In vain the king's diviners daily strove<br />
To find the spring of Ailill's gathering ill;<br />
In vain Etain by stream and murmuring grove<br />
Sought for the shadowy hand that held his will;<br />
And when dark Balor cracked his whip, and drove<br />
His winter herd across the bounds of day,<br />
Ailill upon his couch in weakness lay.<br />
<br />
So when a year had passed, and through the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
The king went forth on royal pilgrimage,<br />
Unto Etain he gave his last command<br />
That she, his brother's sickness to assuage,<br />
Withhold no gift, but give with regal hand;<br />
And should chill death blow out his flickering blaze,<br />
His funeral-stone with honour she should raise.</td></tr>

From day to day Etain with eager thought<br />
Outran sick Ailill's fleetest-footed needs;<br />
From sun and wind a subtle medicine caught,<br />
And charmed swift healing from the fresh-strewn reeds<br />
Upon his floor, which her own hands had brought<br />
From ferny hollows, where cool waters laughed<br />
That Ailill from her cup with gladness quaffed.<br />
<br />
Yet with each dawn that came with growing power<br />
There grew a cloudy thought in Ailill's mind<br />
That gloomed the joy of health's returning hour,<br />
And put a sigh in evening's gentle wind,<br />
And touched with ill-timed frost life's opening flower,<br />
And turned to poverty the proffered wealth<br />
In hands that wrought his sickness and his health.<br />
<br />
And she, in service, found a hidden way<br />
To strange new meanings in the eyes of life;<br />
And reached a joy beyond the shrill affray<br />
Of horns and harps loud with the songs of strife<br />
Or little triumphs of a passing day;<br />
And grasped, in giving, life's most perfect gift&mdash;<br />
Love that is raised by that which it doth lift.<br />
<br />
So moved the twain through sunshine barred with gloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><br />
Finding in each twin solace and despair:<br />
He, like a frail and gently tended bloom,<br />
Grudged each day's health that took him past her care;<br />
And she, o'ershadowed by approaching doom,<br />
Watching his need of her grow less and less,<br />
Sickened with grief her lips dare not express.<br />
<br />
Tossed thus on hidden billows of the soul,<br />
And swept by winds that warred against the will,<br />
They drained the little draught in life's poor bowl,<br />
And all unwitting wrought each other ill;<br />
Until at last, stung past the heart's control,<br />
Marking Etain's white brow and pensive eye,<br />
Thus Ailill broke the silence with a cry.<br />
<br />
"O bitter joy! O sorrow passing sweet!<br />
O blossoming life that leads to love's pale death!<br />
O gain that speeds to loss on laggard feet!<br />
O living voice that kills the word it saith!<br />
O cooling touch that kindles quenchless heat!<br />
How shall I all my heart's dear burden speak,<br />
Or how keep silence at thy paling cheek?<br />
<br />
"I love thee, Queen Etain, but in such wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><br />
As never man loved woman heretofore:<br />
Not with the love that lives upon her eyes,<br />
And counts her breast the summit and the shore<br />
Of all desire, and with tempestuous sighs<br />
Flings to the winds the spoils of reason's thrift<br />
In barter for her body's utmost gift.<br />
<br />
"My love, O queen, is that serener kind<br />
Whose word outruns the lumbering wain of speech,<br />
And springs in light from mind to answering mind;<br />
And takes its bliss beyond the body's reach,<br />
Thought mixed with thought, as sunlight with sweet wind;<br />
And crowds the ways, where human sorrow pleads,<br />
With generations of exalted deeds.<br />
<br />
"Ah, then take back the life that thou hast spent<br />
In vain, since thou dost slay and heal my heart;<br />
And let quick death beat down my failing tent,<br />
And its lone habitant be blown apart<br />
Through the wide wastes of night's black firmament,<br />
Where move the Powers in whose dread hands may be<br />
The source and end of dreams and destiny.<br />
<br />
"There past the chain of hours my faithful ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br />
May through thy dreams move silently and dim;<br />
And needing then the least, may serve thee most;<br />
Or crying seaward from life's misty rim,<br />
Call forth thy heart beyond its mortal coast:<br />
Happy if in thy spirit's wakening sigh<br />
My name one murmured moment live and die."<br />
<br />
Thus Ailill spoke; and like a summer shower<br />
His eager words, tingling on heart and brain,<br />
Stirred many a leaf to life, and many a flower;<br />
And sank beneath her spirit's thirsty plain,<br />
Till hidden springs, touched with a strange new power,<br />
Welled in her eyes with flash of sudden streams<br />
From hills that crowned some far-off world of dreams.<br />
<br />
Clear-visioned in her meditative eye<br />
Rolled the great world, and lo! a silent moth<br />
Shredded its mighty frame, till down the sky<br />
It fluttered like a poor discarded cloth<br />
From some dead face flung out by hands that die;<br />
And thinned like vapours round the lips of day,<br />
And like a breath passed utterly away.<br />
<br />
And as it passed she knew that nevermore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br />
Life would be life again; yet in her mind<br />
Lurked the dim fear of one who leaves the shore,<br />
And on the sightless hazard of the wind<br />
Moves into doubt and darkness. O'er and o'er<br />
She turned her thought, till softly on her ear<br />
There broke a song a bard was chanting near.<br />
<br />
<i>Because the strong are fallen low,<br />
Who deems that Strength himself is slain?<br />
Through depth and height his arm shall go,<br />
And he shall rear his house again,<br />
Although the strong are fallen low.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Because the living all are dead,<br />
Who deems that Life has found a grave?<br />
Among the stars she lifts her head,<br />
She dances lightly on the wave,<br />
Although the living all are dead.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Because the beautiful has passed,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><br />
<i>Was Beauty but a passing word?<br />
Behold, the dust through chaos cast<br />
With lovelier loveliness is stirred,<br />
Although the beautiful has passed.</i><br />
<br />
<i>And if earth's lovers love amiss,<br />
Who deems that Love has perished quite?<br />
Lo, cloudy lips the mountains kiss,<br />
And day is bosomed on the night,<br />
Although earth's lovers love amiss.</i><br />
<br />
Swiftly and silently her thought's faint wing<br />
Sought between wind and wind a certain way;<br />
For one was keen with glad awakening<br />
In perfumed morn of some ecstatic day;<br />
And one was loud with song, and quivering string,<br />
And all life's pageantry and noisy breath<br />
Wherewith men strive to drown the voice of death.<br />
<br />
Then said Etain: "King Eochaidh in his might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><br />
Drew me to bonds of happiness; but thou<br />
Art as a voice that calls across the night<br />
To where some dawn blows freshly on the brow,<br />
And love with love moves freely as the light,<br />
Mingling in happy dreams their shadowy wings<br />
Beyond these perishing substantial things.<br />
<br />
"Ah, me, the pain in joy, the joy in grief!<br />
Who tells the end when once has moved the foot?<br />
Thy hand is on my life's new-opened leaf:<br />
Who knows the hand may pluck its ripened fruit?<br />
To thee&mdash;and past, the journey may be brief.<br />
Yet I the king's behest shall all fulfil&mdash;<br />
'Nothing withhold to heal my brother's ill.'<br />
<br />
"So in the gaze of dawn and wondering flowers<br />
We shall keep tryst by stream and whispering tree;<br />
Perchance to win from life's controlling powers<br />
The healing of thy heart's infirmity;<br />
Perchance&mdash;" "Oh! speed the hazard of those hours,"<br />
He cried, "that blind the flame of low desire<br />
In the white light of Love's transmuting fire."</td></tr>

Hard by the swift-winged star, the moth-like moon<br />
Sheds golden dust on waves of day that ebb<br />
Into the deep beyond life's wan lagoon.<br />
The spider Night now spins his monstrous web,<br />
And spots the dark with many a pale cocoon<br />
Hung in his vaporous cave, whose phantoms creep<br />
In visions round the heavy brain of sleep.<br />
<br />
Yet one, among the sleepers, never turns<br />
To ease his shoulder of the weight of night;<br />
But with the shield of sweet oblivion spurns<br />
Those wandering shafts that tease with sound and sight;<br />
Till in a quiet, deep as kingly urns<br />
In buried places, Ailill deadly lies,<br />
Blind to the spreading signal of the skies.<br />
<br />
Now the thick dark, that pressed Etain's calm face<br />
Like softest wool, thins out, and moves, and lifts;<br />
And like a memory's vague recovered trace<br />
The silent world, looming through cloudy rifts,<br />
Floats greyly on the grey abyss of space,<br />
Then slowly forms, and stands at last in light<br />
Built on the crumbled ruins of the night.<br />
<br />
Soon on a cloud o'erhung with heliotrope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><br />
Day's harp is lifted, wire on golden wire;<br />
And now great Dagda's burning fingers grope<br />
From string to string, then reaching high and higher<br />
Unto the utterance of some eager hope,<br />
Break through the vibrant silences, and spring<br />
Into one living voice of leaf and wing.<br />
<br />
Somewhere the snipe now taps his tiny drum;<br />
The moth goes fluttering upward from the heath;<br />
And where no lightest foot unmarked may come,<br />
The rabbit, tiptoe, plies his shiny teeth<br />
On luscious herbage; and with strident hum<br />
The yellow bees, blustering from flower to flower,<br />
Scatter from dew-filled cups a sparkling shower.<br />
<br />
The meadowsweet shakes out its feathery mass;<br />
And rumorous winds, that stir the silent eaves,<br />
Bearing abroad faint perfumes as they pass,<br />
Thrill with some wondrous tale the fluttering leaves,<br />
And whisper secretly along the grass<br />
Where gossamers, for day's triumphal march,<br />
Hang out from blade to blade their diamond arch.<br />
<br />
Forth came Etain, and with a little cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><br />
Scattered the councils of the feathery brood;<br />
And faced unblenched the red sun's winkless eye<br />
That hawk-like hung above the quivering wood;<br />
And passed with stately step and head on high<br />
Toward a secluded place&mdash;where one doth wait<br />
Silent and imperturbable as fate.<br />
<br />
Sweetly the wizard palms of morning sleek<br />
Her brow with spells; and when a butterfly<br />
Brushes with soft familiar wing her cheek,<br />
Through the deep woods she hears a ghostly sigh,<br />
As if a hidden god were fain to speak<br />
An ancient ageless love that, fold by fold,<br />
Wraps her with joy in throbbing arms of old.<br />
<br />
Now is her sandalled foot upon the edge<br />
Of a loud-leaping stream, that flings its damp<br />
To cool the sorrel shaking on its ledge<br />
Under the squirrel's pine, and in a swamp<br />
Goes dumb among the heron-haunted sedge,<br />
Where the swift kingfisher, a moment seen,<br />
Flashes and fades, a flame of sudden green.<br />
<br />
At length she stands within the appointed place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><br />
Where leafy boughs in odorous dusk are blent.<br />
But wherefore now across her trancéd face<br />
Pass the quick fingers of bewilderment,<br />
And doubt on doubt like shadows shadows chase?<br />
Faintly she speaks, "Ailill I came to see.<br />
Who art thou&mdash;for thou art yet art not he?"<br />
<br />
From her soft eye no loosened glances tell<br />
Desire or dread, to him whose cloudless gaze<br />
Knows from what heights of old her footsteps fell<br />
Out of clear light, into this web of days<br />
And nights and mystery inscrutable,<br />
And marks how in the calm of inner power<br />
She moves unmoved to meet her destined hour.<br />
<br />
"Etain," he whispered, and again, "Etain."<br />
Such utter love went throbbing through her name<br />
That nigh beyond her doubt her foot had gone;<br />
Yet stood she wavering like a lonely flame<br />
Outburning night, that feels the shake of dawn;<br />
Then said, "Thy name, that doubt aside he cast?"<br />
"Mider," he answered, "come for thee at last."<br />
<br />
"Mider?" she echoed, "Mider?" and the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><br />
Smote upon hidden doors, and roused from sleep<br />
Faint eyes that dreamed, vague hands that groped around<br />
The thought behind her thought, and from the deep<br />
Beneath her thought climbed upward, to the bound<br />
Whose shadowy marge like midnight gloom is cast<br />
Between the passing moment and the past.<br />
<br />
Then Mider said, "For no poor worm's desire,<br />
Nor aught of earth, thou comest, O beloved!<br />
But for another's good thy thoughts conspire;<br />
And far from self thy feet have hither moved<br />
To the high purpose of the sacred fire<br />
That burns thine upward path through joy and pain,<br />
Through birth, through life, through death, to me again."<br />
<br />
Then asked she all bewildered: "Who art thou<br />
Whose eyes have read my soul?" And answered he,<br />
"Thine am I by the immemorial vow<br />
That made thee mine, beloved! eternally,<br />
When for a bride-price, on thy peerless brow<br />
I set a diadem beyond the worth<br />
Of all the crowns of all the queens of earth."<br />
<br />
Swiftly her thought divining, "Where, and when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><br />
And wherefore parted, thou, beloved! shalt know.<br />
That land which gleams in the rapt poet's ken,<br />
Set in a sea that has no ebb or flow,<br />
Beyond the spear-cast of the dreams of men,<br />
Is mine, and from all changings far withdrawn<br />
There spreads the realm of Mider&mdash;and Etain.<br />
<br />
"And there we loved, till that Almighty Power<br />
Who set the heavens wheeling with a nod,<br />
Blew thee, a butterfly, from flower to flower,<br />
Until beyond our realm, a splendid God<br />
Knew thee and cherished in a blossomy bower,<br />
And nightly thy fair form in purple laid,<br />
And at thy side his couch of slumber made.<br />
<br />
"But thee again the breath of tempest found,<br />
And swept thee forth, and whirled from field to field,<br />
And dashed thee where a roar of festal sound<br />
Shook brazenly doffed helm and resting shield,<br />
And flung thee in a cup that passed around<br />
To one who drank it deep in bridal mirth&mdash;<br />
And thou wert born a daughter of the earth.<br />
<br />
"From year to year life's pleasures round thee played,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><br />
And fell behind the question of thine eyes<br />
That searched the mysteries of leafy shade,<br />
And the blue heron sailing in the skies<br />
Cutting the silence with the rusty blade<br />
His voice, and sought to spy the subtile might<br />
That killed your gathered iris in a night.<br />
<br />
"Ah, soon I saw sweet longing on thy face,<br />
And love's compelling poppy on thy mouth,<br />
And watched thee robe thy maiden blossoming grace<br />
And dream a king came riding from the south;<br />
Yet in thy sigh in Eochaidh's royal place,<br />
Unseen I saw the waft of hidden wings<br />
Set past these perishing substantial things.<br />
<br />
"For thou wert born for love whose windless sail<br />
Moves on great deeps beyond life's shallow range.<br />
Love linked in flesh with failing flesh shall fail:<br />
Love knit in thought with changing thought shall change,<br />
Nor all desire against slow Time prevail;<br />
For that old worm all dreams shall gnaw and rend,<br />
And love that finds an end&mdash;itself shall end.<br />
<br />
"Oh! not for thee the little irking chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><br />
That frets the bark on life's expanding bole;<br />
Nor love that maketh free, though it contain<br />
All earth's white loves and thee supreme and sole<br />
Beloved beneath all heaven; for who shall gain,<br />
Since between love and love most subtly mixed<br />
Untrodden silence stands forever fixed?<br />
<br />
"My love would brood upon the holy thing<br />
Within thine inmost being folded far,<br />
Till it at length come forth on perfect wing<br />
To brush with sweet eclipse the morning star,<br />
And in high heaven its utter rapture sing,<br />
Filling the universe with golden sound<br />
Of love immortal, measureless, unbound!<br />
<br />
"How shall immortal love find mortal bliss,<br />
Or measureless be bound in narrow speech,<br />
Or free and forge the bondage of a kiss?<br />
Nay, but its end is ever out of reach,<br />
Its life, of fairer life the chrysalis;<br />
And all its days, desirable and fleet,<br />
But prints of unseen Beauty's passing feet.<br />
<br />
"Ah! Love is thine whose all-transfusing sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><br />
Burns out the mystery of life and death;<br />
And all thine hours but blossom unto one<br />
That us in utter bondage compasseth.<br />
Now to that timeless hour Time's footsteps run<br />
To rear our throne, whose foot shall never know<br />
The chafe of life's eternal ebb and flow.<br />
<br />
"And he whose heart long time was scarred and swept<br />
By hungering winds that robbed him of repose,<br />
Wrapt in deep joy, beyond his joy has slept<br />
Into a passionless calm, that wakes and knows<br />
Love's highest bliss in honour stainless kept.<br />
Farewell, and when a little while has flown<br />
I come again." He ceased. She stood alone.<br />
<br />
Far through the morn the horn of Eochaidh blew,<br />
Outspeeding runners hot with glad return.<br />
From post to post goes welcoming halloo:<br />
Far off the shouldered spear-heads dance and burn<br />
Through smother of wheels, and marching men that strew<br />
Their wake with dust and song, and storm at last<br />
Round dun and liss, their prosperous journey past.<br />
<br />
And all that day go question and reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br />
Twin bodkins looping up the stuff of life:<br />
And all that dusk, warm cheek and glancing eye<br />
Blow up love's ruddy peat in man and wife:<br />
And all that night, harps throb and warpipes cry<br />
Around the king, enthroned in joy complete,<br />
Etain beside him, Ailill at his feet.<br />
<br />
But through the songs of praise that round him swell,<br />
One voice to him has music sweeter far.<br />
Close to his heart she now the tale doth tell<br />
Of duty done, and love escaped a scar;&mdash;<br />
But not of that deep hour, unspeakable<br />
With visitation from beyond the world,<br />
Shut in her heart, a blossom closely curled.<br />
<br />
On Eochaidh's royal brow sits glad content<br />
That she, fate's minister to Ailill's pain,<br />
Who dared in faith the perilous descent,<br />
Now stands more white against averted stain.<br />
And Ailill, all his heart in service spent,<br />
Fills their glad hours with tender friendship's light<br />
Sweet as the beam that silvers quiet night.</td></tr>

Now at life's wheel Etain the day-long sings;<br />
Not loud, but low as one who musing waits<br />
An hour, whose promise in her deep eye springs<br />
In keen transfiguring light that contemplates<br />
The mystery of small, familiar things<br />
Made great with gleams from past the verge of sight,<br />
And strange with rumours of the infinite.<br />
<br />
In that bright realm glimpsed through the shade of this<br />
She sees great peace resolve earth's little strife;<br />
And deepening vision sounds a deeper bliss,<br />
Till joy rolls round the fretted shores of life;<br />
And in swift stroke of hate, and love's long kiss,<br />
She marks one law work out one hidden Will,<br />
And life and death one happy doom fulfil.<br />
<br />
So pass her days in labour sped with peace.<br />
And now the king, heart-eased in her repose,<br />
Gathers warm love about him like a fleece;<br />
And through the land his joy wide-circling goes,<br />
Stirring swift hands that bid the earth increase<br />
Her gift of good, till wealth and fatness throng<br />
Their duns with praise, and fill their mouths with song.<br />
<br />
Life's labour widely shared the lightlier lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br />
Along the days; and when its tumults cease,<br />
Free brain and limb are swift in rivalries<br />
Upon the bloodless battlefields of peace<br />
In thought's affray, or deed of strength whose prize<br />
Scarce more adorneth him whose power prevails,<br />
Than him who strongly dares and greatly fails.<br />
<br />
And in long nights, when age and childhood sleep,<br />
Bright eyes that flicker round the rushlit board<br />
Mark how the chess-players, in silence deep,<br />
Meet skill with skill, until delight is roared<br />
At cunning scheme, or swift unreckoned leap:<br />
But, cute as fox or quick as tern awing,<br />
No hand is found to mate King Eochaidh's king.<br />
<br />
Loudly his fame rolls through the echoing land;<br />
But in his dreams, in some high tourney met,<br />
He feels a strong inexorable hand<br />
Counter his craft with calm unwavering threat<br />
By an unseen far-seeing player planned,<br />
That haunts his thoughts with hint of some deep strife<br />
Waged vastly on the board of death and life.<br />
<br />
Then from his couch, with apprehensive eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><br />
Forth goes the king for solace. Mile on mile<br />
His happy realms in dawn's pale radiance lie<br />
Secure in his great strength; so with a smile<br />
He tramples out the night's thin troubling cry,<br />
Then toward his palace turns, lo! at its door<br />
There stands a chieftain never seen before.<br />
<br />
Straightly he stands, nor from his pride's full height<br />
Bends he from neck to knee one purple fold;<br />
Nor dips his spear, nor casts his shield whose light<br />
Glinting from snowy boss and bead of gold,<br />
Strikes from the king some memory of the night,<br />
So that his quickened eye is swift to trace<br />
A touch of challenge in the stranger's face.<br />
<br />
"Welcome, O stranger! and doubly were thy name<br />
To me revealed." "Mider: to thee unknown.<br />
No far-sung dun is mine, lineage or fame;<br />
Yet in my realm I keep a steadfast throne,<br />
And for my pleasure play a subtle game<br />
With pawn and puissant knight and watching queen.<br />
Fame trumpets far thy skill: now be it seen."<br />
<br />
On swift-set piece and jewelled chessboard break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><br />
Slant arrows from the scarcely risen sun.<br />
Rank faces rank. "Play, king!"... "Not without stake<br />
I play; nor bate the forfeit quickly won,&mdash;<br />
Thine?" "Fifty steeds whose hooves shall Erin shake."<br />
Then Eochaidh, lightly at light-seeming task,<br />
"And mine," he smiled, "whatever thou shalt ask!"<br />
<br />
Matchless in skill, King Eochaidh moves elate ...<br />
One moment ... then ... straight lip and slow-drawn breath<br />
Yield sullenly to sure on-coming fate.<br />
Behind his eyes vast shapes of Life and Death<br />
Move hand to hand.... Soon ends the struggle&mdash;"Mate!"<br />
The stranger calls.... King Eochaidh's boast is gone!<br />
"The stake?" he vaguely asks.... "Thy wife, Etain."<br />
<br />
Now like a spider wrapped in his own snare,<br />
The king turned to and fro to rend the spell<br />
Of ghastly loss. Pride stricken to despair<br />
Tugged at life's roof-tree. Round him ruining fell<br />
Puffed hopes and brittle joys that broke in air;<br />
And high desires, reined short in sight of goal,<br />
Stumbled to earth and snapped life's chariot-pole.<br />
<br />
Then in that other's eye some glance revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><br />
Faint pity.... "Nay, not this!" King Eochaidh cried.<br />
"Take thou the treasures won on hard-fought field,<br />
Spoils of the furrow, tribute of the tide:<br />
These for thy forfeit here I freely yield;<br />
Not her whose smile makes festive life's poor crust,<br />
But lost would turn its glories into dust!"<br />
<br />
The stranger calmly answered, "King, the bird<br />
Poised on a little trick within the brain,<br />
Soars sunward. Kings on honour's lightest word<br />
Unshaken, rear a realm that shall remain.<br />
Snaps a small string: lo! all the song that stirred<br />
With beauty and joy, sinks like storm-swallowed ships,<br />
And bards unborn harp a high-king's eclipse.<br />
<br />
"But fear not thou. Thy fame shall feel no wind<br />
Of cold rebuke; for when these shadows lift,<br />
Thou in life's loss the Spirit's gain shalt find:<br />
Thou to thyself shalt give thine utmost gift;<br />
And know thou only hast what is resigned.<br />
I go&mdash;but come on one clear-omened day,<br />
And thou shalt pay thy debt." He went away.<br />
<br />
In that same hour the hungry nestling's cheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><br />
Floods Etain's drowsing ear with gentle woe.<br />
Sleep stirred by waking, waking soothed by sleep,<br />
Around her heart in linking eddies flow;<br />
Till at some passing wind that shakes the deep<br />
Of dream, she wakes with eyes that strain to see<br />
A haunting face behind life's mystery.<br />
<br />
And in lone hours of many a moonless night,<br />
Through jetting poplars and the shooting snags<br />
Of wrinkled oaks, the king doth seek a light<br />
From his heart's questionings, whose purpose flags<br />
Before her face, lest in her eye's clear sight<br />
One thought of faithlessness a moment read<br />
Should bring to birth the thing he most doth dread.</td></tr>

Strong in the strength that finds in gentleness<br />
A way to peace, King Eochaidh on the throne<br />
Of Erin sits. Around his footstool press<br />
High cares of sovereignty, that crowd his own<br />
Like gossips out of doors, and ease the stress<br />
Of storming thought which, held from question clear,<br />
Fears its mute doubt, yet vaguely doubts its fear.<br />
<br />
In silent step, hushed pulse, and listening gaze,<br />
He marks expectancy behind her smile,<br />
Like some faint gleam from half-remembered days<br />
Ere the high Gods had blown them to this isle<br />
Among inscrutable divided ways,<br />
Some hidden destiny to mar or make<br />
In hands as strong to give as quick to take.<br />
<br />
Now to the king the hollow moments haste<br />
Across his heart to some heart-emptied hour:<br />
And now he frets to leap with sinews braced<br />
Through lagging days and meet the threatening power.<br />
Yet from his conflict, inner lips now taste<br />
The mingled wine of sweet and bitter fate&mdash;<br />
Strength to withstand, Endurance to await.<br />
<br />
These not as gifts the shadowy troublers bear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><br />
But on his table spread what is his own.<br />
So mused the king: "Not all from spade and share<br />
The harvest comes: seed to its fruit has grown,<br />
Self-shaped, though stirred by smart of sun and air;<br />
And in life's myriad hands beaten and pressed,<br />
Man is not made, but man made manifest."<br />
<br />
So finding gain in threatened loss, his mind<br />
Self-poised, through sorrow and joy makes even way,<br />
Content if, toiling past, his fingers find<br />
Her fingers, and in trembling silence say,<br />
"Here in unstable circumstance entwined<br />
We two have kissed, and whither we may tend,<br />
Once mixed, must find each other at the end."<br />
<br />
And she within her heart's most secret place<br />
Has nursed a thought that grew from day to day,<br />
Like wind-borne seed that on a rocky face<br />
Finds root and strength to shatter ancient sway,<br />
A thought of Love that chafes at time and space,<br />
And moves from Love that was through Love to be<br />
To some exalted end no eye can see.<br />
<br />
Yet nought of this was uttered each to each;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
But when, like forest monarchs strong and proud,<br />
A silver birch beside a sinewy beech,<br />
They stood at feast to hail the gathering crowd,<br />
Swift winds of joy came full of happy speech,<br />
And through the host light raptures laughed and played,<br />
Witless of yellowing leaf or sodden shade.<br />
<br />
Then came a day when on the bare flag-stone<br />
The slow snail crawled; the chestnut's candles turned<br />
Downward as dead; the wolf-hound with a groan<br />
Gazed in King Eochaidh's eyes through eyes that burned<br />
Great threat; the spear-grass hither and thither blown<br />
Bent on the sand and traced its rings awry,<br />
And sun and moon slid sideways down the sky.<br />
<br />
Swiftly to Eochaidh the dread omens tell<br />
The day of forfeiture; yet to Etain<br />
No word he speaks. Her eyes so softly well<br />
With wondrous beauty, all his heart is drawn<br />
In love to hold her from the coming spell.<br />
Pushed past its hour, the unspoken doom may break,<br />
And love and honour stand without a shake.<br />
<br />
On windy gap and boggy mountain path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><br />
He sets his watchers. Knee-deep where the fists<br />
Of bracken fronds are clenched in tiny wrath,<br />
Stern guards now stand, and where in sculptured cists<br />
Old kings are harvested in Death's long swathe.<br />
Closed from alarm the shingled roofs now rise<br />
Ringed through the dark with flaming searching eyes.<br />
<br />
The word has passed, "The king shall have his whim:<br />
No stranger looks upon the queen to-night."<br />
Around the feasting board men great of limb<br />
Shut fast each door, and blind the hope of sight<br />
With shining shields that turn the torches dim.<br />
Throned firm in strength defying power or guile,<br />
He joys, and hopes&mdash;yet fears Etain's faint smile.<br />
<br />
Now harp and song have touched their utmost height,<br />
And fall in sudden silence at a sound<br />
Deeper than sound, and pale before a light<br />
Clearer than light. Above, beneath, around,<br />
All heaven and earth are shaken with a might<br />
Past might, swift chariots clash, and mixed with these,<br />
Far thunderings and the roar of distant seas!<br />
<br />
And in their midst is Mider, a shining God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><br />
From whose majestic presence swiftly spreads<br />
Peace not of earth. Before his face, unflawed<br />
By shadow of taint, brave warriors bow their heads.<br />
And now the king, snapping his silver rod<br />
Of power, with sudden eyes made clear, with cheeks<br />
Flamed by swift vision, through the silence speaks.<br />
<br />
"Now have I seen the shining hand of Him<br />
Who sifts the world for His divine desire;<br />
And gathers, and within His quern's wide rim<br />
Grinds all things meet for His transforming fire,<br />
And kneads them to a purpose far and dim;<br />
Who fashions all things to His growing plan,<br />
And breaks ... and moulds ... and breaks the heart of man.<br />
<br />
"Take Thou Thy will&mdash;so it be her's?..." A hope<br />
Shoots a faint arrow instantly&mdash;no more.<br />
A blinding fire falls from night's glimmering slope.<br />
Flame-like the twain meet on the rushy floor&mdash;<br />
And vanish. King and clansmen blindly grope<br />
Into cool air. Across the sky two swans<br />
Fly slowly toward the day that palely dawns.</td></tr></table>

A bird once came and said to me,<br />
"Hear how the mountains came to be.<br />
An angel from his crystal sphere<br />
Fell to the earth. A chilly fear<br />
Shot thro' his wings from tip to tip,<br />
For there was neither boat nor ship,<br />
Mountain nor stream, nor maid nor man,<br />
Far as the angel's eye could scan;<br />
Dead flatness far as he could see<br />
Before the mountains came to be.<br />
He stretched his wings to fly away,<br />
But round his feet the oozy clay<br />
Gripped fast, and held him to the ground.<br />
He stretched and strove until a sound<br />
Went thro' him from he knew not where<br />
And said, 'The only way is prayer.'<br />
He dropped his wings and raised his eyes,<br />
And sent his soul into the skies.<br />
He prayed and prayed, and as he prayed<br />
A wind among his plumage played<br />
And bore him upward toward his sphere.<br />
Around his feet from far and near<br />
There came a sound that seemed to say,<br />
'Pray on! pray on! we too would pray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span><br />
Thy prayer has touched the sleeping Powers:<br />
Pray on, thy prayer shall yet be ours;<br />
We too have wings that pine for flight,<br />
We too have eyes that long for light.'<br />
Upward he moved, and still his eyes<br />
Were fastened on the distant skies,<br />
And as he rose toward heaven dim<br />
He drew the earth up after him.<br />
About his feet the oozy clay<br />
Gripped fast, but could not stop or stay<br />
His course, till on his skyey stair<br />
He paused beyond the need for prayer,<br />
While from the air beneath, around,<br />
There rose a tumult of glad sound.<br />
The angel turned the sound to seek,<br />
And lo! his foot was on a peak<br />
That fell away to where the world<br />
Lay like a painted flag unfurled<br />
And shaken out from sea to sea,&mdash;<br />
And thus the mountains came to be."<br />
So said the bird, and what the masque<br />
Of meaning hid, I meant to ask;<br />
But off he flew before I knew&mdash;<br />
And yet I think the tale is true<br />
If one could only hear aright,<br />
And see with something more than sight.</td></tr></table>

Quoth Icarus to Daedalus:<br />
"Before these Cretans make a fuss,<br />
And set our names up with a shout,<br />
Perhaps we'd better first get out,<br />
And show the master-mind of Us,"<br />
Quoth Icarus to Daedalus.<br />

Then round and round went Daedalus,<br />
And out and in went Icarus.<br />
They parted for an hour's whole space....<br />
They met upon the selfsame place!<br />
"I think we're stuck," quoth Icarus,<br />
"I think we are," quoth Daedalus.<br />

'Spite of our mouths with freedom filled,<br />
From life's poor trivial things we build<br />
A maze about the feet of us<br />
That shuts us in like Daedalus.<br />
<br />
But Daedalus and Icarus<br />
Made wings, and set them&mdash;thus, and&mdash;thus;<br />
And that blind maze that hemmed them in<br />
They sloughed, as drops the snake its skin:<br />
And so at last shall all of us,<br />
Like Daedalus and Icarus.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Etain the Beloved</i>:&mdash;This poem is founded on an ancient Irish myth. It
is not a translation from the Gaelic; but rather is an attempt at
transfiguration, by seeking to "unfold into light" the spiritual vision
that was the inspiration, and is the secret of the persistence and
resilience, of the Celt. Such modifications as I have made in the story
have neither archæological nor philological significance: they arise
entirely from whatever measure of insight into artistic necessity, on
the side of pure literature, has been granted to me; and also from
obedience to a view of the universe which is embodied in the ancient
Irish mythology, and whose operations the personages of the story body
forth as Psyche bodied forth the soul of humanity to the Greek.</p>

<p>The names of the personages may be pronounced thus: Etain&mdash;Etawn',
Eochaidh&mdash;Yo'hee, Ailill&mdash;Al'yil, Mider&mdash;Mid'yir.</p>

<p>Dagda is the Irish God of Day, Balor the Irish God of Night.</p>

<p>A dun is a fortified dwelling, a liss is a place for domestic animals.</p>

<p><i>Death and Life</i>:&mdash;On Friday, August 13, 1909, the author went by
currach from Dunquin to the Great Blasket Island, Kerry, to visit Miss
Eveleen Nicolls, M.A., who was spending a holiday on the island. Instead
of joining her, as was intended, in music and conversation amongst the
islanders, he had to participate in an endeavour, alas! unsuccessful, to
restore her to life. She had been bathing with a fisher-girl. The latter
got into difficulties in the strong Atlantic current, and an effort by
Miss Nicolls to save the girl ended in the heroic sacrifice of her own
life.</p>

<p><i>A Schoolboy plays Cuchulain</i>:&mdash;Cuchulain, the supreme hero of Celtic
romance, who, single-handed, defended his province against the army of
Queen Maeve. Maeve had chosen for a foray the time when the Ulster
chiefs lay in weakness under a curse by the warrior Goddess, Macha.</p>

<p><i>Hospitality</i>: <i>The Student</i>:&mdash;Put into verse from the literal
translations of Kuno Meyer in "Ancient Irish Poetry."</p>

<p><i>To One in Prison</i>: <i>A Home-coming</i>:&mdash;Occasioned by the imprisonment of
the author's wife for taking part in the active movement for the
political enfranchisement of women.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
